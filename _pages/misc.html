<h2 style="color: #5F9EA0;">Support for Students</h2>

<p align="justify"><b>College or graduate school as a first-generation student</b>: presents with unique challenges that aren't always apparent to others. This includes grappling with financial concerns, or simply feeling out of place, and seeking help might seem daunting. As a fellow first-gen student, I am happy to support fellow students who might benefit from my research on relevant resources available.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Navigating advisor transitions in a PhD</b>: Drawing from my own experiences, I've gathered strategies and resources to help towards potential next steps when an academic advisor(s) leaves or when there is a need to switch labs multiple times. This article titled <a href="https://www.jfmclaughlin.org/blog/when-your-advisor-leaves" style="color: #3333FF;">"When your advisor leaves"</a> from James McLaughlin's Lab Blog resonates with my experiences and thoughts on the topic, and might be a useful starting point for anyone faced with a similar situation.</p>
<p align="justify">If you're facing any of these challenges or others not mentioned here, please reach out to me via email. I am happy to help in any way.</p>

<h2 style="color: #5F9EA0;">Other Interests</h2>
<p align="justify">In my free time, I enjoy running, biking, snowboarding, and listening to/collecting vinyl records. In another life, I was also a singer trained in Indian Classical Vocals and part of an acapella group.</p>
