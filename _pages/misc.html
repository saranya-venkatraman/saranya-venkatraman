<h2 style="color: #FF5733;">Support for First-Generation Students</h2>

<p>Navigating college or graduate school as a first-generation student presents unique challenges that aren't always apparent to others. This includes grappling with financial concerns, or simply feeling out of place, and seeking help might seem daunting. As a fellow first-gen student, I am happy to support fellow students who might benefit from my research on relevant resources available.</p>

<h2 style="color: #33FF77;">Navigating Advisor Transitions in a Ph.D.</h2>

<p>Drawing from my own experiences, I've gathered strategies and resources to help towards potential next steps when an academic advisor(s) leaves or when there is a need to switch labs multiple times. This blog titled <a href="https://www.jfmclaughlin.org/blog/when-your-advisor-leaves" style="color: #3333FF;">"When your advisor leaves"</a> from James McLaughlin's Lab Blog is an article that resonated with my experiences and thoughts on the topic and might be a useful starting point for anyone faced with a similar situation.</p>

<p>If you're facing any of these challenges or others not mentioned here, please reach out to me via email, and I am happy to help in any way.</p>
