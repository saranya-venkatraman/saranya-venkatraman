Hi! I'm a PhD student at Pennsylvania State University in the Informatics (Data Science & Artificial Intelligence) track. I'm advised by <a href="https://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/" style="color: #757575; text-decoration: none" target="_blank">Prof. Dongwon Lee</a> and a member of the <a href="https://pike.psu.edu/index.html/" style="color: #757575; text-decoration: none" target="_blank">PIKE research group</a>). I am also a Visiting Scholar at New York University in <a href="https://hhexiy.github.io" style="color: #757575; text-decoration: none" target="_blank">Prof. He He</a>'s group.
