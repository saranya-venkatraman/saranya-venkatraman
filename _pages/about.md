Hi! I'm a PhD student at Penn State in the Informatics (Data Science /& Artificial Intelligence, DSAI) track. I'm advised by <a href="https://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/" style="color: #757575; text-decoration: none" target="_blank">Prof. Dongwon Lee</a> and a member of the <a href="https://pike.psu.edu/index.html/" style="color: #757575; text-decoration: none" target="_blank">PIKE research group</a>).
