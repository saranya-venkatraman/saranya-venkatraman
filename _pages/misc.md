Support for Students
  
I'm a first-generation college/graduate school student and have experienced first-hand some of the challenges that it presents. Being first-gen can lead to an experience different from one's peers, making such students less likely to reach out for help. I am happy to support anyone who might benefit from my research on resources for first-generation students in grad school.

I'm also someone who has experienced discontinuous advisor-ship (i.e. academic advisor(s) leaving the institution) and having to switch labs multiple times. This can also be a difficult experience to cope with, though there exist many resources and strategies to move forward. This blog titled ["When your advisor leaves](https://www.jfmclaughlin.org/blog/when-your-advisor-leaves) from James McLaughlin's Lab Blog is an article that resonated with my experiences and thoughts on the topic and might be a useful starting point for anyone faced with a similar situation. 

If you are a student experiencing any of the above-stated challenges or more, please feel free to reach out to me via email and I am happy to help in any way.
