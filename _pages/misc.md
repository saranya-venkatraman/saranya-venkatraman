<h2>Support for First-Generation Students</h2>

<p>Navigating college or graduate school as a first-generation student presents unique challenges that aren't always apparent to others. The journey can feel isolating, grappling with financial concerns, or simply feeling out of place, and seeking help might seem daunting. As a fellow first-gen student, I understand these struggles firsthand. I am happy to support anyone who might benefit from my research on resources for first-generation students in grad school.</p>

<h2>Navigating Advisor Transitions</h2>

<p>Experiencing discontinuous advisor-ship can be disorienting and discouraging. The sudden departure of an academic advisor or the need to switch labs multiple times can disrupt your academic progress and leave you feeling adrift.</p>

<p>Drawing from my own experiences, I've gathered strategies and resources to help navigate such transitions. This blog titled <a href="https://www.jfmclaughlin.org/blog/when-your-advisor-leaves">"When your advisor leaves"</a> from James McLaughlin's Lab Blog is an article that resonated with my experiences and thoughts on the topic and might be a useful starting point for anyone faced with a similar situation.</p>

<h2>Reach Out for Support</h2>

<p>If you're facing any of these challenges or others not mentioned here, please reach out to me via email, and I am happy to help in any way.</p>
